################ Features List ################
Note: features are neatly listed and documented in the code as well
Note: for efficiency, I will describe similarly groupable features with common language, rather than listing each one.  They are, for the most part, self-explanatory.

* image size (number of pixels), and aspect ratio (width/height)
* the average value, median value, and standard deviation of the red, green, blue, and luminosity (combined RGB) channels
* the average value, median value, and standard deviation of the pixel value for vertical and horizontal edge maps, as well as the proportion of pixels above a certain threshold value for the horizontal and vertical edge maps.
* The number of image peaks

-- The above totals 23 features in all


################ Classifier Metrics ################
Note: all of these metrics are visible in the notebook
Best Score = 
Random Guessing = 2% ( = 1/(# of classes) )
Machine learning is 14 times better than random guessing

Top 3 features (see notebook for full importance list):

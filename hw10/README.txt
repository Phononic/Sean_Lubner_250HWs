Sean Lubner

Notes:
* Required Modules: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy.  

* Make sure to preserve file structure of repo.  

* File uploader checks to make sure that neither the file, nor that user-specified collections name, has already been used before during that session.

* Server saves a copy of the file to its uploads folder.  The server clears out the uploads folder each time it is relaunched.

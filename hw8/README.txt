AY250 Homework 7

Sean Lubner

To avoid clogging up the git repo / the grader's computer, I did not upload the json file.  Simply replace the json_file_path variable at the top of the notebook to a locally stored copy, and it will propagate through to the rest of the notebook.

All the problems are explained within the notebook with markdown and comments.
